# Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

The purpose of this project was to demonstrate how to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal was to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

## Deliverables 
1) a tidy data set 
2) a link to a Github repository 
3) a code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations 

## Data
One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained:
